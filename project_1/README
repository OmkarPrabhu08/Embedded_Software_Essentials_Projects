Wrote a firmware to perform basic functions related to memory like memset memcpy etc also to convert big endian to little endian and ascii to integers and vice-versa 

Also wrote makefile to compile files for 3 platforms Beaglebone black, Freedom Freescale, Host machine.

Commands for using Makefile

#This is the default goal and will build for the host on which it's running
make

#This will compile and link files and create final binary called project1 in ./bin
make build

#This will compile all files and create object files in ./src
make complie-all

#This will build a library in ./lib and create final binary called project1 in ./bin
make build-lib

#This will create a preprocessed file in ./src. Change file.i for the name of the file you want to build for
make src/file.i

#This will create an assembly file in ./src. Change file.s for the name of the file you want to build for
make src/file.s

#This will create an object file in ./src. Change file.o for the name of the file you want to build for
make src/file.o

#Appending PLATFORM=bbb in the above commands will create files and binaries for beaglebone
make PLATFORM=bbb build

#Appending PLATFORM=frdm in the above commands will create files and binaries for freedom platform
make PLATFORM=frdm build

#This will clean the directory
make clean
